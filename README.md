# Django Helm Chart

This is a first attempt to create a generic helm chart for [Django Cookiecutter](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django).

This is initially a rework/simplication of https://gitlab.com/glitchtip/glitchtip-helm-chart and was used for Google
Cloud Platform deployment with Terrafom by https://aahi.io - an Apex Labs project.

Help, ideas, PR and other contributions are very much welcome.
